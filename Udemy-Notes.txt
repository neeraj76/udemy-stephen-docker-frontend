React App Exited With Code 0
4-1-2020

Recently, a bug was introduced with the latest Create React App version that is causing the React app to exit when starting with Docker Compose.

To Resolve this:

Add stdin_open property to your docker-compose.yml file

  web:
    stdin_open: true
Make sure you rebuild your containers after making this change with  docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build
